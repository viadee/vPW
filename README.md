<p align="center">
The viadee Process Warehouse (vPW) enables the analysis of process data that is generated during the execution of process instances on a process engine (e.g. Camunda). The analyst can define his metrics on a functional level (i.e. based on the process model) and visualize them on the process model. The insights gained by him can be used to optimize the process model (cf. BPM lifecycle).

## Commitments

This library will remain under an open source licence indefinitely.

We follow the semantic versioning scheme (2.0.0).

In the sense of semantic versioning, the resulting JSON outputs are the only public "API" provided here. We will keep these as stable as possible.

## Roadmap
This software is considered to be stable and ready for production use.
However, we plan to extend on it if there is demand or if the APIs change.
